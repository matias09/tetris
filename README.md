# Tetris
This code is only an incomplete gameplay implementation of the Tetris Game.
To give you an idea, when you run it, starts showing a grid with boxes with
the same color as a representation of a board.

All the pieces of the natural game are of the same color.
There is no HUD and when you won or loose, the game automatically close it.
This is far away of DONE, but, in my case, helps me as a Start with SDL.

My Current objective with this, is to Delete it and made it again with a
DOP approach and add some Graphips Lib.
