# Tetris
This code is only an incomplete gameplay implementation of the Tetris Game.<br/>
To give you an idea, when you run it, starts showing a grid with boxes with<br/>
the same color as a representation of a board. <br/>

All the pieces of the natural game are of the same color.<br/>
There is no HUD and when you won or loose, the game automatically close it.<br/>
This is far away of DONE, but, in my case, helps me as a Start with SDL.<br/>

My Current objective with this, is to Delete it and made it again with a<br/>
DOP approach and add some Graphips Lib.
